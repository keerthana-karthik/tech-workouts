What and Why of CSS
-------------

CSS means Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to style the HTML documents.

**Why use CSS?**

We can style the HTML documents like changing the color of text in a page, changing the background of the page or element or aligining the content in the page..etc

Let's see an example for changing the color of all paragraphs in a HTML document

```
// You instruct the broswer to use the following style for all p tags
p {
  // All the <p> tags should be in red colors
  color: red;
}
```
