What and Why of HTML
-------------

HTML means Hyper Text Markup Language. You can consider this as a word document for the web which can be understood by browsers. Just like your word program like Pages or OpenOffice or Microsoft Word which can open a .doc or .odt file for you to read the contents, a browser can understand the contents of a HTML file and shows it as a readable format to you.

**How to use HTML?**

In HTML everything is represented as a set of tags. For example if you want to show your user a paragraph of text, you wrap it around a **<p>** tag

Let's see an example for a paragraph tag

```
<p>This is a paragraph text. When this is viewed in a browser, the browser will show you this text in a paragraph</p>
```
